    "The Deezer Europe Social Network dataset consists of 28,281 users and 92,752 mutual follower relationships, making it a large yet sparse network with a density of only 0.00023. On average, each user maintains about 6.56 connections, and the clustering coefficient of 0.0959 indicates a modest tendency toward small friendship circles where friends of friends are also connected. Because not all users belong to the same connected component, the largest connected component (LCC) is extracted to provide a meaningful foundation for further analysis. This dataset, with its binary gender labels, offers a valuable opportunity to explore centrality measures across categories, assess homophily, and compare how structural importance differs between groups."

    "The Deezer Europe Social Network comprises 28,281 users and 92,752 edges, where each edge corresponds to a mutual follower relationship. The network is highly sparse, with a density of only 0.00023, meaning that users connect to a very small fraction of all possible connections, an expected property of large-scale social platforms where relationships are formed selectively. On average, each user maintains approximately 6.56 connections, reinforcing the observation that while the network is large, individual connectivity is relatively modest. The clustering coefficient of 0.0959 suggests a moderate likelihood of triadic closure: if one user connects with two others, there is roughly a 9.6% chance that those two users are also connected. This highlights the presence of localized friendship circles or small communities within the broader structure. Because not all nodes are guaranteed to be part of the same connected component, the largest connected component (LCC) is extracted for analysis, ensuring that centrality measures and categorical comparisons are computed on the most structurally meaningful portion of the graph."

    "To make these statistics interpretable and provide meaningful insights, several visualizations will be incorporated into the analysis. A histogram of degree distribution, plotted on a log-log scale, will illustrate how connectivity varies across users while highlighting the existence of highly connected hubs. A boxplot of degree centrality by gender will compare connectivity between male and female users, enabling us to assess whether one group tends to maintain more connections. The bar chart of class distribution will show the proportion of users in each gender category, providing a quick assessment of balance or skew in the dataset. A pie chart of homophily will capture the tendency of users to connect with others of the same gender versus across genders. Finally, a subgraph visualization (sampling 200–300 nodes) will be produced, where nodes are colored by gender and sized by degree centrality, offering an intuitive view of the network’s structure and categorical clustering."

    "The purpose of this project is to investigate how structural importance in the Deezer Europe Social Network differs across categorical groups, with a particular focus on the binary gender attribute assigned to each user. The project aims to construct the network from the provided edge list, attach categorical information to each node, and calculate node-level measures such as degree centrality and eigenvector centrality to capture both direct connectivity and overall influence. These measures will then be compared across gender categories using descriptive statistics and visualizations, including histograms and boxplots, to identify potential patterns or disparities. To formally assess whether any observed differences are statistically significant, appropriate statistical tests, such as t-tests or non-parametric alternatives, will be applied. Ultimately, this analysis seeks to interpret the results in the context of social network behavior, providing insight into whether gender plays a role in shaping connectivity patterns and positions of influence within a large-scale online community."
